## Index

| Tag | Open when task touches… | One-line rule |
|-----|-------------------------|---------------|
| `qr-routing` | QR, scan, deep links, ESL tags | **Only** `scanRouting.ts` + `receiveQrUrls.ts` — never duplicate logic in App/Receive/Pickup |
| `zone-lookup` | staging code → delivery | `getDeliveryDetailsByStagingCode`; match zones via `getAllStagingLocationIds` |
| `receive-deep-link` | `/receive` URL params or camera | `deepLinkPending` before camera; failed lookup → show error (no silent empty screen) |
| `encode-qr` | building QR URLs | `receiveQrUrls.ts`; always `encodeURIComponent` on params |
| `html5-qr-type` | camera scanner | `Html5QrcodeInstance` from `qrScannerTypes.ts` — no `any` |
| `delivery-status` | new `DeliveryStatus` | update `RECEIVE_BLOCKED` and `ZONE_CLEARED` in same change |
| `backend-critical` | rules, CF writes, schema | archetype `backend-write-critical`; Sonnet gate before deploy |
| `billing` | model / tier pick | Composer 2.5 default; Sonnet 4.6 for gate/review only |
| `agent-lessons` | repeating mistakes, "say fixed" too early | Read **§ agent-lessons** before public routes / UI pickup fixes |
| `scope-rejections` | portal nav, Settings vs Vendors, duplicate sidebar | Read **PROJECT_STATUS/USER_SCOPE_REJECTIONS.md** — do not re-ship rejected UI |

## § qr-routing
- Entry points: URL deep link, camera callback, manual input — all call `handleScannedQr(raw, target)`.
- Targets: `"receive-page"` \| `"checkin-page"` \| `"app-checkin"`.
- Zone tags: `buildZoneEslQrUrl` — pickup-ready → `#/pickup?job=`, vendor flow → `#/receive?id=`, empty → `#/receive?zone=`.

## § zone-lookup
- QR routing: `getDeliveryDetailsByStagingCode` (includes pickup-ready).
- Receive-only (exclude blocked): `getDeliveryDetailsPublicByStagingCode`.
- Occupancy map: `mapActiveZoneOccupancyByCode`.

## § billing
- Composer 2.5 = orchestrator + default worker (included quota).
- Sonnet 4.6 = security gate + authority review only (on-demand cost).
- **Public Firestore writes:** code fix + `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules` in the same session — `npm run deploy` (gh-pages) does not ship rules.

## § backend-critical
- Trial: Composer implements; Sonnet grades. 3/5 clean passes.
- Mandatory Sonnet gate after rules/CF/schema **and** multi-file route/Firestore read changes.

## § agent-lessons (2026-06-02 — pickup portal arc)

Hard-won mistakes — **read before declaring UI/Firestore work done.**

1. **Do not say "fixed" without Playwright.** Build alone is insufficient. Interactive flows need `scripts/verify-*.mjs` (clicks + assert end state). Pickup: `npm run verify:pickup` then `:prod` after deploy.
2. **`npm run deploy` ≠ Firestore rules.** gh-pages ships the SPA only. Public technician writes need `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --project stageverify-db` in the **same session** as the code change.
3. **Public routes must not call auth-only reads.** `listDeliveries()` loads `jobs` → empty or throws when logged out. Pickup uses `loadPickupReadyDeliveriesPublic()`. Any new public page: audit for `getDeliveryDetails`, `listDeliveries`, `fetchAll<Job>`.
4. **`recordPickupEvent` / technician writes:** use delivery doc + batch write; never reload `getDeliveryDetails` after commit on technician path (permission denied for unauth).
5. **Logged-in browser ≠ Playwright.** Dan may see data while headless test sees empty list — always verify unauthenticated or with the verify script.
6. **Confidence downgrade when user still sees the bug.** Code-only fix that doesn't deploy rules or pass E2E → lower conf, do not mark ok until Playwright + user path green.
7. **Auto-submit and Done must share the same gates** (shop stock + staged item checklists) — any second code path bypassing a gate will reproduce the bug.
